# docker-saltstack
Docker Compose setup to spin up a salt master and minions.

You can read a full article describing how to use this setup [here](https://medium.com/@timlwhite/the-simplest-way-to-learn-saltstack-cd9f5edbc967).

You will need a system with Docker and Docker Compose installed to use this project.

Just run:

`docker-compose up`

from a checkout of this directory, and the master and minion will start up with debug logging to the console.

Then you can run (in a separate shell window):

`docker exec salt-master bash`

and it will log you into the command line of the salt-master server.

From that command line you can run something like:

`salt '*' test.ping`

and in the window where you started docker compose, you will see the log output of both the master sending the command and the minion receiving the command and replying.

[The Salt Remote Execution Tutorial](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/modules.html) has some quick examples of the comamnds you can run from the master.

Note: you will see log messages like : "Could not determine init system from command line" - those are just because salt is running in the foreground and not from an auto-startup.

The salt-master is set up to accept all minions that try to connect.  Since the network that the salt-master sees is only the docker-compose network, this means that only minions within this docker-compose service network will be able to connect (and not random other minions external to docker).

#### Running multiple minions:

`docker-compose up --scale salt-minion=2`

This will start up two minions instead of just one.

#### Host Names
The **hostnames** match the names of the containers - so the master is `salt-master` and the minion is `salt-minion`.

If you are running more than one minion with `--scale=2`, you will need to use `docker-saltstack_salt-minion_1` and `docker-saltstack_salt-minion_2` for the minions if you want to target them individually.
